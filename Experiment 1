AIM: 
Create a new process by invoking the appropriate system call. Get the process identifier of the currently running process and its respective parent using system calls and display the same using a C program.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1 : Start program.
Step 2  : An existing process can create a new one by calling the fork() function.
Step 3 : The new process created by fork() is called the child process.
Step 4  : We are using her getpid()to get the process id.
Step 5 : Stop program..
PROGRAM:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{

  printf("Process ID: %d\n", getpid() );
  printf("Parent Process ID: %d\n", getppid() );

  return 0;
}

INPUT AND OUTPUT:
1139
1137
 
RESULT:
Thus the program has been successfully implemented using system call
